You've forgotten how to do something. Again. You know what it is, but can't remember the sequence.

You've googled it before.

Use this command in `vim`:

```
:!h copy
```

```
vim: copy / yank - y (paste with p)
tmux: copy - ctrl-b [ (enter mode: ctrl-b [, use arrow keys, copy: ctrl-space, paste: ctrl-b ])
```

## Installation / update

```
go install
```
