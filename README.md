## Search for commands

You've forgotten how to do something. Again. You know what it is, but can't remember the sequence. Add it here, and you can use the `h` command to find it again.

```
h copy
```

```
vim: copy / yank - y (paste with p)
tmux: copy - ctrl-b [ (enter mode: ctrl-b [, use arrow keys, copy: ctrl-space, paste: ctrl-b ])
```

### vim usage

Within vim you can enter an exclamation mark to run a command. So, you can use the following command to look up `copy`:

```
:!h copy
```

## Installation / update
